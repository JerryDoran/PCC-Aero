        </h1>
        <p>
          Commercial air travel is the safest form of intercity transportation
          in the United States. Every day U.S. airlines transport more than 2.4
          million passengers and more than 58,000 tons of cargo. Safety is our
          number one priority. PCC Aero and our member alliances work together
          with the Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation
          Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, Department of
          Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration, Customs and
          Border Protection, aircraft manufacturers, labor and others to provide
          a safe and efficient travel experience. As a result, the U.S. airline
          industry is experiencing the safest period in aviation history.

          <strong class="accent">creator</strong> of markets
        </h1>
        <p>
          Commercial aviation helps drive more than 10 million American jobs and
          5 cents of every dollar of U.S. GDP. Our member alliances contribute
          at the local, state, national and global levels, helping to
          transporting people and goods around the world safely, efficiently and
          economically. The industry supports and creates new markets at home
          and abroad, as communities across the world rely on access to air
          transportation for economic growth and stability.

          <strong class="accent">improved</strong> fuel efficiency
        </h1>
        <p>
          Between 1978 and 2018, U.S. airlines improved fuel efficiency by over
          130%, which has resulted in nearly 5 billion metric tons of carbon
          dioxide savings. Our partners have a strong record of environmental
          responsibility. Today, our engine components are quieter, cleaner and
          use less fuel than ever. Carriers continue to invest in new aircraft
          and engines, winglets, alternative fuels and operational procedures –
          both in-flight and on the ground – among many other initiatives to
          create cleaner, greener skies for us all.
        </p>
        <h1 class="safety"><strong class="accent">Driver</strong> Of Jobs</h1>
        <p>
          Our member alliance partners provide wide-ranging job opportunities
          from engineering to customer services. For every 100 airline jobs,
          approximately 300 are supported outside of the airline industry both
          directly and indirectly, including aviation-related government agency
          positions, such as air traffic controllers employed by the FAA, and
          research and development positions that enable advancements in all
          facets of airline operations.
