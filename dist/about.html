                  Precision investment casting injects wax into an aluminum
                  cavity. Aluminum has a lower cost, is easier to cut, and less
                  expensive to maintain. Using wax also is easier on tooling,
                  allowing it to maintain consistent parts for many more uses.
                  Investment casting allows for ferrous and non-ferrous metals
                  (aluminum, brass, bronze, etc) to be cast.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our casting process requires less expensive equipment, and is
                  inherently less dangerous, allowing costs to remain lower.
                  Castings also can hold much tighter tolerances, reducing the
                  amount of machining typical to forgings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Precision investment casting uses a ceramic mold that can
                  produce a much smoother finish, typically averaging 125 Ra
                  surface finish as cast. Investment castings also greatly
                  reduce the amount of machining that will be required after
                  casting by holding a .005”/inch tolerance for the majority of
                  applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our casting process can cut down labor time and offer one
                  continuous part that has a consistent and clean look to the
                  end user. The reduction of labor time reduces lead times and
                  cost of castable applications. The consistency in castings can
                  also lead to lower scrap, lowering final costs even further.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Investment castings reduce waste, labor time, and machine time
                  that causes machining to be costly. PCC Aero's precision
                  casting process, in tandem with PCC Aero's precision
                  machining, can offer the best of both processes. The use of
                  both processes allows us to give the best possible price for
                  casting, but allowing the end user to be able to install
                  threads, hold tight tolerances, and improve surface finish
                  where necessary.

                  Human Factors Engineering is the study of our interaction with
                  the physical world around us, and the application of these
                  principles in design. These interactions are especially
                  relevant when designing a products to ensure that the user has
                  a comfortable and intuitive experience. Our designers have
                  this concept at the forefront of their mind during the design
                  process to ensure the interaction is designed well.

                  Nickel alloys are heat-resistant alloys used for jet engines
                  and gas turbine blades. We started using the term “alloy
                  design” after the phase computation (PHACOMP) method was
                  developed in 1964 to predict the formation of harmful and
                  brittle phases (e.g., σ phase) in nickel-based superalloys.
                  This PHACOMP method has been widely used for the design and
                  quality control of nickel-based superalloys.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nickel-based alloys possess several properties which make them
                  well suited for use in extremely severe conditions and
                  environments. Nickel alloys are very resistant to oxidation
                  and corrosion and when heated form a thick, stable,
                  passivating oxide layer, protecting them from further attack.
                  Nickel alloys also retain their strength over a wide range of
                  temperatures. This makes them particularly attractive for use
                  in high temperature applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To make Nickel Alloys, we start with the purest available raw
                  materials to achieve the required chemical composition. A
                  correct chemical composition is necessary to give uniform and
                  required properties to different alloys. We have a completely
                  integrated manufacturing facility; starting from the melting
                  stage. Melting is performed in modern state-of-the-art vaccuum
                  furnaces. We use special techniques to control impurities and
                  inclusions. We employ unique processing techniques ensures
                  consistency and high quality.
