          <strong class="accent">World Leader</strong> of Steam Turbine
          Components
        </h1>
        <p>
          For more than a century, we have consolidated the best available
          technology from numerous steam turbine suppliers into core platforms
          that support our advanced, innovative, efficient, and reliable steam
          turbine solutions. PCC Aero has highly-qualified and specialized
          engineering centers and factories in key markets around the world.
        </p>
        <h1 class="power-title">
          <strong class="accent">high</strong> availability and reliability
        </h1>
        <p>
          Our robust, reliable steam turbine components are enhanced by control
          systems and the power of PCC Aero Digital solutions. Our proprietary
          long-term testing program validates material behavior and ensures
          steam turbine component reliability. Get extended maintenance
          intervals and increased turbine availability from advanced methods
          during the design phase.
        </p>
        <h1 class="power-title">
          <strong class="accent">enhanced</strong> operational flexibility
        </h1>
        <p>
          Advanced fracture mechanic methods provide reliable lifetime
          assessment of the steam turbine components and increased cycling
          capabilities. An enhanced blade groove design reduces thermal stresses
          for increased rotor life.
        </p>
        <h1 class="power-title">
          <strong class="accent">high-efficiency</strong> last-stage blades
        </h1>
        <p>
          Our enhanced last-stage blade portfolio offers: 
          <p>Dense staggered last stage blade sizes for project specific cold-end conditions and
            increased efficiency (up to 60’’ for 50Hz and up to 50” for 60Hz).</p>            
          <p>A robust design with stress-enhanced grooves and blade attachments for
            higher reliability· Features such as full tip shroud, enhanced tip
            section with low shock loss, aerodynamic part span connector, and
            increased root-reaction that improve steam turbine performance.</p>          
          <p>Advanced radial vortexing improves performance and hood integration
            over a range of loads.</p>
